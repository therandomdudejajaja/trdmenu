this was heavily inspired by mspaint; most if not all releases are gonna be niche and a small amount of them will actually do anything big.

i have no idea how to remove the linoria cursor so either deal with it or tell me.
if you wish for a game to be included in this, open an issue. i'll respond when and *if* i see it.
it's either gonna be accepted, declined for whatever reason, or i'm too bad at luau to make it.
